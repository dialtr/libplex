# libplex

## About
The **libplex** library provides functions useful in communicating with
Plex servers. The initial version provides the GDM class, which allows
users to enumerate the Plex servers and clients that exist on the local
network.

## Status
This project is in **alpha**. It doesn't do much yet except enumerate
Plex servers to the console. It also hangs at the moment because it uses
a blocking-mode socket.
